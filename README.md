## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
The Traditional way of maintaining details of a user in a bank was to enter the details and record  them. Every time the user needs to perform some transactions he has to go to the bank and perform  the necessary actions, which may not be so feasible all the time. It may be a hard-hitting task for  the users and the bankers too. The project gives real life understanding of the Online Banking  System and activities performed by various roles in the supply chain. Here, we provide  automation for the banking system through the Internet. Online Banking System project captures  activities performed by different roles in real life banking which provides enhanced techniques  for maintaining the required information up-to-date, which results in efficiency. The project  gives real life understanding of Online Banking System and activities performed by various roles  in the supply chain
